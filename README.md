# Sudoku-SkillCraft-Technology
Create a Program that solves Sudoku puzzles automatically. The program should take an input grid representing an unsolved Sudoku puzzle and use an algorithm to fill in the missing numbers.

**Project Overview**
This is a simple Sudoku Solver built using Python's tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). It pre-fills part of the 9x9 Sudoku grid with numbers and allows the user to input the missing values. The program includes functionality to automatically solve the puzzle and clear the board.

**Features**

- The Sudoku grid comes pre-filled with some numbers to give you a head start on the puzzle.
- You can input your own numbers into the empty cells using the interactive GUI.
- Our program uses a backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle.
- If the puzzle cannot be solved, an error message will be displayed.
- To start a new puzzle, simply use the reset button to clear the board.

**Technologies Used**
-Python 3.x
-tkinter for the GUI components.
